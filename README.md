# :robot: VR with CG and AI

This repository is maintained as collections of applications, technology, demos in virtual reality(VR) within the era of computer graphcis(CG) and artificial intelligence(AI) from the perspective of HCI.

As our focus is to research into human-centric VR, there is one definitive guidebook named as ["Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective"](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Computer-Interaction-Empirical-Research-Perspective/dp/0124058655) and we should review regularly to build delibrate user study in VR.

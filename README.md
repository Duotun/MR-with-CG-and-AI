# :robot: MR with CG and AI

This repository is maintained as collections of applications, technology, demos in mixed reality(MR) within the era of computer graphics(CG) and artificial intelligence(AI) from the perspective of HCI.

As our focus is to research into human-centric MR, there is one definitive guidebook named as ["Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective"](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Computer-Interaction-Empirical-Research-Perspective/dp/0124058655) that we should review regularly to build deliberate user study in MR.

There is also a trending that we may pay attention to: between-subject user study becomes more preferred than in-subject user study, especially talking with design principles, system effectiveness, and group behaviors.

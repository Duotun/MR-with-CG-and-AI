# :robot: MR with CG and AI

This repository is maintained as collections of applications, technology, demos in mixed reality(MR) within the era of computer graphics(CG) and artificial intelligence(AI) from the perspective of HCI.

As our focus is to research into human-centric MR, there is one definitive guidebook named as ["Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective"](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Computer-Interaction-Empirical-Research-Perspective/dp/0124058655) that we should review regularly to build deliberate user study in MR.

There is also a trending that we may pay attention to: between-subject user study becomes more preferred than in-subject user study, especially talking with design principles, system effectiveness, and group behaviors.

# :church: Affective Computing in MR
In this part, we would like to explore excellent research in performing user study on how MR technology will help to build a better system to understand human beings' affections, perception and psychological activities in various context. Moreover, with MR technology's advancements, researchers are working on developing innovative systems to provide more inspirations, more engagements, more accessibility to people in need.

# :robot: MR with CG and AI

This repository is maintained as collections of applications, technology, demos in mixed reality(MR) within the era of computer graphics(CG) and artificial intelligence(AI) from the perspective of HCI.

As our focus is to research into human-centric MR, there is one definitive guidebook named as ["Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective"](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Computer-Interaction-Empirical-Research-Perspective/dp/0124058655) that we should review regularly to build deliberate user study in MR.

There is also a trending that we may pay attention to: between-subject user study becomes more preferred than in-subject user study, especially talking with design principles, system effectiveness, and group behaviors.

# :moon_cake: Sketch in MR
An excellent collection of sketch applications could be found in this [github repository](https://github.com/MarkMoHR/Awesome-Sketch-Based-Applications). I would also highlight important publications from my perspective.

- [Experimental Evaluation of Sketching on Surfaces in VR](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3025474), Arora et al., CHI 2017

# :church: Affective Computing in MR
In this part, we would like to explore excellent research in performing user study on how MR technolocy will help to build a better system to understand human beings' affections, perception and phychological activities in various context. Moreover, with MR technology's advancements, reseachers are working on developing innovative systems to provide more inspirations, more engagements, more accessibility to people in need.
